# Instructions

## How to Download This Repository

This is usually called "cloning." To clone this repository (AKA all this stuff in one lump sum), please follow the instructions below:

1. [Install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). This will make your life easier!
2. Complete options to set up GitHub Desktop, including signing into GitHub.
3. Select the option to clone this repository (ensure you're selecting this one, called ASEN-2804-Lab created by Goandget1) into your folder of choosing. GitHub Desktop will automatically create a folder for the stuff and put it there.
4. You're done!

## How to Edit Changes

Before doing anything, please note:

- GitHub manages repositories in terms of branches, best thought of as different "versions" to manage.
- By default, there is a main branch, but editing main directly isn't smart because you can easily cause conflicts with other peoples' work.  

You will want to create your *own* branch! This ensures you're not affecting anyone by changing anything they were working on.

To create your own branch:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Select "current branch" at the top of the window, and then "New Branch"
3. Name it what you want, and click create!
4. Select "Publish to GitHub," and you're done!

To edit your branch:

1. Ensure your "current branch" is the branch you are editing in GitHub Desktop!
2. Do what you want to do locally, on your machine (no need to go to GitHub itself to edit anything).

## How to Upload Changes

To upload your changes to your new branch:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. You make changes to the repository through "commits." By default in GitHub Desktop, all changes you've made will be added to the commit. Depending on your needs, you can change what is added to the commit by checking or unchecking files.
3. Give your commit a name! (i.e. "Adding new design", "Edited such and such code")
4. Select "commit", and then click "Push origin" at the top of the window (commits are only saved locally, "push origin" puts it on GitHub).

## What if I need to make changes to code/work other people are using?

If this happens, please let me know. Allowing other versions to use new fundamental code is tricky business and requires strong knowledge of Git.

Likely what I would do in this situation is call everyone (or at least the people who need it) to commit the changes they've made and pause new changes for ~15-20 minutes while I do some manual rearranging.

## Why follow these instructions?

GitHub is a very useful tool but with it assumes you know how to use it, so it can very easily break if you do anything it assumes you know not to do.

With this management, you get all the benefits of the shared workspace but much less headache. If there's anything you don't know how to do, or want to do, ask me and I'll do my best!
